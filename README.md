# Help Hub

An app that helps to match non-profits with volunteers. Currently the volunteer portal is available, log in securely to the site or create a new account, complete your profile with volunteer interests and skills, see upcoming events on the calendar and new blog posts, or join in the community chat room!

Help Hub is a responsive, mobile ready app that matches non-profits with volunteers. The landing page presents the user with an active Volunteer button. When clicked, the user is presented with a login/signup screen. Once they submit their profile, they are taken to their dashboard. This consists of a calendar, a chat window and a blog. The calendar will display events that have been posted by registered non-profits. The chat window will connect them in real time to other users. The blog section will display blog entries by registered non-profits.
